## Description
This program will allow someone creating a D&D character to input race, class, etc. to get character stats without doing any math themselves. This program is text-based, and most inputs are numerical based on the displayed menu options. In addition to the main output file, files are used to allow access to information between different functions, classes, etc. I also found that it was the easiest way to organize large groups of information that would be outputted at a later point. I used classes as an organization method, as each D&D class has different class-specific stats and abilities.

`sheet_template.txt` is the mock-up template I created as a baseline for the output layout. `charactercreator.py` contains the actual program's code and functions, including main. `final_character_sheet.txt` is the final output file. `project.py` includes all classes. All other files are for internal use within the program. `README.md` and `requirements.txt` are also included as per project requirements.

The scope of this project made it quite daunting! However, I am glad I stuck to it, as I was able to improve on my python coding ability, especially with file handing and complex cross-referencing of variables. Thank you for taking the time to view my project.
